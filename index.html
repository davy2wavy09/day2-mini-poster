  <h1>Consequences in not Thinking</h1>

  <!-- Subtitle or slogan -->
  <h3>Think Twice before you Think Once</h3>

  <!-- Body text -->
  <p> It's important to pause and think twice, because impulsive decisions can lead to unintended consequences. Acting without considering the full picture may hurt others, damage relationships, or create problems that are hard to undo. Taking a moment to reflect allows you to weigh the potential outcomes, consider different perspectives, and make a more thoughtful, responsible choice. Often, that brief moment of reflection can prevent a mistake and lead to a better path forward.</p>
